PressPatron makes it easy to support the future of journalism, via crowdfunding, membership payments and donations.

I'm helping improve the application from a prototype to an application that will handle traffic from several popular news sites.

Technologies used: Ruby on Rails, Docker, Chef, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, AWS, Stripe, PHP
