Berg was an award winning design agency that started exploring IoT and connected devices.

I joined Berg to help with the expansion of the BergCloud platform. When I arrived, the initial proof of concept was struggling to support 500+ devices. I enabled it to handle much larger loads and moved the design from a polling implementation to a streaming system that delivered messages in an event stream.

Technologies used: Ruby on Rails, Python, Node.js, C++/Arduino, MySQL, Javascript, WebSockets, Redis
