I led a cross functional team supporting the warehouse operations and logistical software. The system included multiple backend API services as well as Android apps for staff. The team consisted of several Android developers, a UX designer, as well as devops, full stack and back end developers.

My main achievement was supporting more than one operational location, allowing the business to expand and to start planning for UK wide operations.
