Farmdrop is building a new low impact supply chain to deliver fresher and better food and improve returns for farmers and producers.

I led a cross functional team supporting the warehouse operations and logistical software. The system included a Ruby On Rails/Javascript/React frontend and multiple Ruby on Rails backend API services as well as Android apps for staff. The team consisted of several Android developers, a UX designer, as well as DevOps, full stack and backend developers.

My main achievement was supporting more than one operational location, allowing the business to expand and to start planning for UK wide operations.

Technologies used: Ruby on Rails, React.js, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Heroku, PostgreSQL, Redis, Android/Java/Kotlin.
