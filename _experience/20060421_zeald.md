Zeald is a supplier of custom designed E-Commerce web sites.

I joined Zeald after university and learnt Perl and HTML/CSS while there, quickly becoming proficient in their CMS system. I then started developing client customisations to some of the more complex sites including paypal integrations.

Technologies used: Perl, PHP, PostgreSQL, MySQL, HTML/CSS, Javascript.
