Artfinder started as a recommendation engine for visual art and then pivoted into print sales of emerging artists.

In the Artfinder team I worked in Python and Django ingesting large collections of art works from partners and working on new ways of recommending and helping people discover art they liked.

Technologies used: Python/Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Memcached, Varnish, AWS, Puppet.
