Trike provides prototyping and bespoke web app development.

At Trike I quickly learnt Ruby and Ruby on Rails and worked on many client applications and internal prototypes. I also adapted and extended the Reddit R2 codebase for making other online community websites.

Technologies used: Ruby on Rails, Python, AWS, Heroku, MySQL.
