I'm available for contracts or freelance development in Auckland🇳🇿 or remotely🌏 and I am open to the right full time role.

Most recently, I have been leading a team on the rearchitecture of a running system to support multiple sites. The system is now running smoothly supporting two locations with more planned to open.

The languages I'm currently most familiar with are Python, Ruby and Javascript. I am also happy to revise my knowledge of Java and C#, or to use something new or different such as Go, Kotlin or Erlang.

I am used to working with small teams in an agile development process and some variant of TDD or BDD.

See my [CV](cv).

## Contact me

Email me at [hi&#64;pkqk.net][enquire]. I’m currently considering part time contracts or freelance development work, though I may be looking for full time work later in the year.
